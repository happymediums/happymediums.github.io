# Guitaricons

Guitaricons is an interactive design project by Jim Morrison for the BDes Interaction Design degree at Ulster University.

The project, developed for Creative Entrepreneurship, involves digital product design and the creation of an icon set.

The idea I had for Guitaricons, and for 'A Jimi Hendrix Experience', was to design a set of icons that represented the iconic musician, helping create an all new Jimi Hendrix experience for people to enjoy.

If you'd like to see the Guitaricons in action, just visit http://jimmorrison.io/guitaricons/

Feel free to download the Guitaricons featured, or if your feeling extra creative, you can download 'A Jimi Hendrix Experience' colouring book.
