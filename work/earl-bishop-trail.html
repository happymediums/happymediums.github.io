        <p>The Earl Bishop Trail is a Irish Heritage & Culture trail located along the north coast of Ireland.
         Stretching from Carrick-a-rede, across the Giants Causeway, through Portrush, and on to Derry/Londonderry.
       Our foundation degree were commissioned by Causeway U3A to produce a website, graphics & photographs as part of
      an interactive media project.</p>

          <blockquote><p>As part of the project, we had to design & build a wesbite, that contained relevent information & links
          to tourism within the local areas surrounding the trail.</p>
            <p>This also involved an expedition to the north coast, following the trail as the Earl Bishop would have
            in order to document, photograph & video the trail for use on the promotional website.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>This was a group project involving 15 team members, including myself as project manager.
  The project was split into three groups; website design & development, digital composition and
  digital graphics.</p>

  <p>The website team researched into tourism, heritage & culture websites,
  looking at what the current digital market offered in terms of presentation and content.
  The digital composition team looked after photography and motion graphics, while the digital
  graphics team designed the client logo, website icons and UI features</p>

<p>With weekly group meetings, team members would have an opportunity to swap over and engage with a
  different project team, looking at how different ideas and points of view and construct
  an engaging overall design and project.</p>
<div class="smallredbreak"></div>
  <h2>Digital Graphics</h2>

<p>The logo created for the Earl Bishop trail was inspired by the Mussenden Temple,
  and designed by <a href="http://www.niamhthompson.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Niamh Thompson</a>.
   An iconic piece of architecture, sitting on the edge of a cliff, along the coast,
   this was the library of the Earl Bishop, which can be found along the trail near at
   Downhill House, near Castlerock.</p>

<p>We felt that as an iconic symbol it worked so well to promote the Earl Bishop,
  as well as provide significant relevance to the north coast of Ireland.</p>

<h2>Digital Compositions</h2>
<p>Along with some amazing photography, the digital composition team developed beautiful cinemagraphs
  that could be used on the website and other digital publications, including The Giants Causeway &
  Binevenagh mountain. You should check out the <a href="http://www.earlbishopstrail.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">website</a> for more examples of the teams' photography skills.</p>

  <div class="info-section">
<h2>Website Design</h2>
  <p>The website is designed to be an accessible one-page format,
    with focus on the visual beauty that is the north coast of Ireland.</p>

  <p>With vibrant iconic imagery, clean layout and interactive navigation, the website sets itself apart
   from a normal historic or tourism website</p>

   <p>As the saying goes 'no one comes to Northern Ireland for the weather', we blend unique iconic scenery and settings
      including The Dark Hedges, Dunluce Castle, The Giant's Causeway and the Mussenden Temple, with tourism information and
      local irish art & gifts.</p>

    <div class="imgbox">
      <img src="/assets/img/earl-website.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p>We used Mapbox to create a customised interactive map to be used on the website,
      allowing trail visiters to use the site as navigation while their on the ground, and used the parallax effect to define sections and call-to-actions.
    The icons for the 'on the trail' and 'at your service' sections have hover interaction applied, engaging you to find out what is just below the surface.</p>
      <p>I think the overfall finish of the website speaks volumes about the team behind it, and all
        the work that has gone into building something rather unique in terms of tourism promotion and heritage information.</p>
