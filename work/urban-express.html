			<p>Based in the heart of Belfast, just a stones throw away from St George's Market,
				Victoria Square and Belfast Central Train Station, Urban Express brings fresh high quality
				sandwiches and snacks to Belfast's busy workers.</p>

				<blockquote><p>Urban Express established itself at the end of the summmer in 2016 and
					therefore required branding, identity, website design &
					development and graphic design for promotional material.</p>
					<p>The main goal of this project was to create an identity and brand for Urban Express that would help
					define the sandwich & coffee shop, in an ever growing food retail market.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Branding & Identity</h2>
<p>Meeting with the client, we first broke down the main elements that were required for the project.
	This included graphic elements both the shop interior, such as sign boards & window manifestations,
and promotional material, including loyalty cards, flyers and exterior overbag graphics.</p>

<p>After speaking with the client, the brand keywords were developed:
	<blockquote>Casual, Relaxed, Atmospheric, Modern, Natural</blockquote></p>

<p>We decided to keep the colour scheme neutral,
	going for a traditional coffee & cream effect, throughout the branding.
	At the same time we wanted to attract the busy office worker, while retaining a casual
	look and feel.
	<div class="smallredbreak"></div>
<p>The first step was to design a logo that would help define the clients brand, researching similar
brands in the market, not only in Belfast, but also within the UK & US.</p>

	<p>What we came up with was a logo that we felt communicated the brand of the business effectively.
		Focusing on typography, a graffiti-esque typeface was used for the main 'Urban' text, creating a sense
		of its city centre location, while the 'Express' text used a chunky clean font, emphasising its moreish,
		flavour-filled food.</p>
		<p>The circular 'ring' around the main logo text added a casual, quirky feel to the design, inspired <body>
			coffee stains on work notes.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the key features of the location was the glazed partition windows that sweeped the across the front
	of the shop. I felt that something special had to go here, to help the shop stand out from its competitors and
	help drive additional foot fall into the shop.</p>
		<div class="smallredbreak"></div>
<p>Finding an silhouette of Belfast city, I decided to add some missing features, including 'Samson & Goliath',
	the Harland & Wolff cranes and 'The Balls at the Falls', two iconic structures in Belfast skyline.</p>
	<p>The cityscape graphic really stood out as an additonal branding element, and so was used for the window manifestations, in promotional
material, and on the <a href="http://urbanexpress.online" target="_blank" class="inline-link">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Website Design</h2>
<p>The client wanted a website with an integrated CMS, enabling their staff to post updates and maintain content.
	Have experience building on the Wordpress platform, along with the 'Divi' wordpress plugin. I was able to design &
	develop a custom website for the client.</p>
	<div class="smallredbreak"></div>
	<p>The website is designed in a one-page format, with the possibility of an additonal 'blog' section in the future.
		The brand elements communicate through the design, including use of colour scheme and typography, as well as a
		defined company message and language.</p>
