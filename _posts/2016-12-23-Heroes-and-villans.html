    <p>
    The Heroes & Villans project for Narrative & Storytelling consists of web markup, as well as design and development of a one-page website
    </p>
<h3>Main Design Elements</h3>
    <p>My inital ideas came from the text itself, explaining the history of the characters and the overall Sherlock Holmes story.
    </p>

    <p>
    Originally published during the end of the 19th century, my design ideas came from both the original publication itself, as well as old newspaper layouts and design from the era.
    </p>
    <div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/assets/img/heroes/old-paper.jpg"></div>

    <p>
      This gave me a good layout framework to work from, along with different design elements I would be able to include within the site.
      This included the two column layout of the content, as well as the type and style of typography that could be used.
    </p>


    <div class="imgbox"><img src="/assets/img/heroes/wu-main-title.jpg"></div>


<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>For the typography, I decided to choose two serif typefaces to be used, one for the headings and another of body text.
  The headings on the site used the 'Cinzel' typeface, which is a really nice bold serif type, while for the body text I chose 'Mate SC',
   another serif type which I think look similar to old-school newspaper typography. Both typefaces are available from <a href="http://fonts.google.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Google Fonts</a></p>
 </p>

 <h3>The Navigation</h3>
 <p>Keeping with the old newspaper theme of the website, I decided to create a header section to house the main navigation links, similar to the date/time areas of the old papers.
</p>
<p>
  I then added <a href="https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll" target="_blank" class="inline-link">smoothscroll.js</a> to each link in order for the scroll action to be smooth as the user navigates down the page.
  Along with this, I applied a <a href="http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">hover.css</a> class to the navigation links in order to produce the slide underline when the link is hovered.
</p>
<h3>Main Content</h3>
<p>The main body of the website is built using <a href="https://www.flexboxgrid.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Flexbox Grid</a>, as I really liked the functionality of re-ordering sections through media queries.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/assets/img/heroes/wu-flexbox-image.jpg"></div>
<p>I felt that the flexbox layout allowed me to re-create the column effect, while at the same time being able to re-order the section, particularly to re-order the placement of images in relation to the relative text sections.
</p>
<p>Along with this, I used the 'column-count' CSS property, which allowed me to overflow text into two columns, while changing back to one based on media queries.
</p>

<p>I also decided to add in a digital publication of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, from The Strand magazine.  I embedded the content, wrapping it inside responsive CSS, allowing the user to experience the publication if they wished, while staying on the website.
