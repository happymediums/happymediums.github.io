<p>
  Originally I had thought of producing a design that was more focused towards a 6-10yr old demographic, but after reading the article, and researching more about National Geographic magazine, the website and the tv channel, I decided to go for a more streamlined design, paying homage to iconic National Geographic design and typography.
</p>
<p>
  I really love the style and design of the National Geographic magazine and wanted to design a site that reflected essentially a one-page National Geographic digital publication, retaining its iconic style and design.
</p>

<p>
For the introduction section of the site, I decided to take my cues from the front cover of the National Geographic magazine, creating an image inside the iconic yellow border, almost a like the window looking into another world.
</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>
  On the National Geographic website, the use of a crisp ‘Sans’ typeface really sits out against an otherwise serif typeface document.  I liked the distinct contrast of the typography within the articles, and felt it would be appropriate adapt for my own design.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to keep the typography close to the magazine and digital publications, and so opted for the ‘Julius Sans One’ for headings, a beautiful sans-serif typeface, and ‘EB Garamond’, a really nice serif font for body text, both available from <a href="http://www.fonts.google.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Google Fonts</a>.  I felt this matched quite nicely with the typography already in use on the National Geographic website,
</p>

<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-julius-image.png"></div>

</p>
<p>
The section titles are then followed by a distinctive yellow horizontal break. I added this because I felt it helped add more of a national geographic felt to the main content and help break up the text further.
</p>

<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-title-image.png"></div>

<p>
Juilus Sans One
</p>
<p>
I really liked the curvature of this Sans-serif typeface, and felt it added a distinct elegance to the design, while staying true to the nature of National Geographic publications.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-body-image.png"></div>

<p>
Using EB Garamond for the body typeface I felt was important to match the body typography styles within NatGeo articles, including the Georgia typeface.  As the Georgia typeface wasn't available via Google Fonts, I felt EB Garamond was a very close substitute, and worked really well with the Sans-serif heading typeface.
</p>

<h3>Interactive Map</h3>

<p>
I added the interactive map via <a href="http://leafletjs.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Leaflet.js</a> & <a href="http://www.mapbox.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Mapbox</a>.  Using the Leaflet.js framework, I including the map as a fullscreen interactive section with zoom function.  I also included a custom marker within the map, creating a illustrateted Takage bird, which I felt worked quite nicely with the style of the map tiles.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-map-image.png"></div>


<p>
I then added a pop-up to the marker, including some information from within the article, with a small call to action to scroll further.
</p>
<p>
I attempted to add markers to the map as additional interactive tools, adding anchor links to the pop-up that would then scroll to related anchor on click.  Sadly I have not got this function to work just yet, so rather than complicate things, I keep just one marker on the map, until I can develop my Leaflet.js skills further.
</p>
<h3>
Interactive film scene
</h3>
<p>
I had been playing around with <a href="http://www.scrollmagic.io" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Scrollmagic</a> for the last few months, and really liked the idea of an interactive film scene that would play as the user scrolled past.
</p>
<p>
Using Scrollmagic image sequencing, I was able to build an interactive film section as an added reference visual within the article.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-film-image.jpg"></div>


<p>
I managed to find a video on youtube of the discovery of the Takahe in 1948, and really like the old film grain sequence and relevance to the article.  I managed to trim between 3-5 seconds of the video and convert this into an image sequence for use on the website.
</p>
<p>
I then surround the image sequence container with the distinctive National Geographic yellow borders to help frame the element within the page.
</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>
I matched similar styles to the tables found within the document, adding a thick border around the overall table and thin border within the table rows and columns.  I also added a small interactive hover feature to the table, with the element background and text colour changing with a smooth css transition.
</p>

<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-table-image.png"></div>


<p>
I used <a href="http://www.materializecss.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Materialize.css</a> to create the parallax sections & effect on the website. Materialize is a really nice framework and plugin, similar to Bootstrap, and I wanted to try it out for these projects.
</p>
<p>
I really like these mini sections that help break up the main content text, but also help tell a story on their own.  Not only does it help add vibrancy from the visual imagery, but it help place the image within the article in a more dynamic and interactive way.  Each parallax container also contains its own content with is affected by interactive scrolling.  The parallax text fades in & out on based on scroll position, helping bring relevance to the image behind, while also inviting the user to scroll further to see what else appears.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-parallax-image.png"></div>


<h3>
The menu
</h3>
<p>
The menu I chose for this project is a simple pop-out menu with ‘scroll to’ navigation links.  I styled the menu to match the national geographic framed border and colour.
</p>

<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-menu-trigger-image.png" id="trigger-image"></div>

<p>
On click, a micro-animation changes the ‘hamburger’ symbol to an ‘x’ to close the menu, and a pop-out overlay appears with the navigation links
</p>
<p>
I've styled the pop-out with the ‘Julius Sans One’ typeface, while also adding a background colour and text colour change on hover.
</p>
<div class="imgbox-small"><img src="/projects/takahe/img/wu-menu-out-image.png"></div>


<p>
I decided on a minimal fixed position menu, as to not distract from the main article, but that can also stand its own ground as a distinctive element within the design.

<p>I really liked designing and developing for this project, and playing around with new ideas for user interaction. I feel the overall design and style is true to the subject matter and existing National Geographic publications.</p>

<p>One of my favourite features is the scroll interactions via Scrollmagic, and I think they help bring the document to life, appearing and inviting the user to scroll down further to find out more information.</p>
