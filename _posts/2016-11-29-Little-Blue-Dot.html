      Designing with content.<br>
      Masterclass 1.</p>
    </blockquote>

<p>A Masterclass with Chris Murphy, we explored the idea of Micropublications, taking an idea, through concept, development and design to produce a possible digital/analog application within a few days.

<h3>Idea Generation</h3>
<p>
From an inital concept of space photography and weather notifications, the idea took hold of bringing together a way in which we could find out information about whats happening on our planet using an interactive globe.
The information would cover a range of topics which could help create a better understanding of the world and our place in it.

<h3>Research & Development</h3>

<p>
I began to look at various applications including Google Earth, NASA and National Geographic the limitations of each and how the 'Little Blue Dot' app could be placed within the market.
I then began to look at how the information could be accessed and displayed within the app by defining the required elements and wireframing the screen layout accordingly.

<h3>Concept Design</h3>
<p>
I wanted to make sure that the main focus was on interaction, using touch gestures to search and find information via an interactive globe. The key was to allow easy access to navigate and find information without the need to type in a searchbar for content; providing a more passive approach to tailoring and receiving information, content and updates from the world around us and beyond.
