<p>Carbon, the sixth most abundant element in the universe, has been known since ancient times.<br><br>
	Carbon is most commonly obtained from coal deposits, although it usually must be processed into a form suitable for commercial use.<br><br>
	Three naturally occurring allotropes of carbon are known to exist: amorphous, graphite and diamond.</p>

<p>Composed of a single proton and a single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe.<br><br>
It is estimated that 90% of the visible universe is composed of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is the raw fuel that most stars 'burn' to produce energy.<br><br>
	The same process, known as fusion, is being studied as a possible power source for use on earth. <br><br>
	The sun's supply of hydrogen is expected to last another 5 billion years.</p>
