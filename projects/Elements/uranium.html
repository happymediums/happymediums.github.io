<h2>Appearance</h2>
<hr>
<p>
A radioactive, silvery metal.
</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Uranium is a very important element because it provides us with nuclear fuel used to generate electricity in nuclear power stations. It is also the major material from which other synthetic transuranium elements are made.
</p>
<p>
Naturally occurring uranium consists of 99% uranium-238 and 1% uranium-235. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissionable fuel (a fuel that can sustain a chain reaction). Uranium fuel used in nuclear reactors is enriched with uranium-235. The chain reaction is carefully controlled using neutron-absorbing materials. The heat generated by the fuel is used to create steam to turn turbines and generate electrical power.
</p>
<p>
In a breeder reactor uranium-238 captures neutrons and undergoes negative beta decay to become plutonium-239. This synthetic, fissionable element can also sustain a chain reaction.
</p>
<p>
Uranium is also used by the military to power nuclear submarines and in nuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
Depleted uranium is uranium that has much less uranium-235 than natural uranium. It is considerably less radioactive than natural uranium. It is a dense metal that can be used as ballast for ships and counterweights for aircraft. It is also used in ammunition and armour.

<h2>Biological role</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Uranium has no known biological role. It is a toxic metal.
</p>
<p>
	The average human body contains about 3 milligrams of fluoride. Too much fluoride is toxic. Elemental fluorine is highly toxic.
</p>
<h2>Natural abundance</h2>
<p>
	Uranium occurs naturally in several minerals such as uranite (pitchblende), brannerite and carnotite. It is also found in phosphate rock and monazite sands. World production of uranium is about 41,000 tonnes per year.
</p>
<p>
	Extracted uranium is converted to the purified oxide, known as yellow-cake. Uranium metal can be prepared by reducing uranium halides with Group 1 or Group 2 metals, or by reducing uranium oxides with calcium or aluminium.
