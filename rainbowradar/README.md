# Rainbow-Radar

Rainbow Radar is an interactive design project for BDes Interaction Design at Ulster University.

The project involves designing and prototyping a weather app for the module 'Designing User Experiences', researching and developing UX design skills and knowledge for the development of connected products.

The idea behind the 'Rainbow Radar' is to use existing weather, topographic and geolocation data to help predict the appearance of rainbows, but with the focus on designing an interface that is suitable for children, fun to use and fit for purpose.

The final build isn't completed yet, but watch this space, and it will hopefully be up soon:
